    				<p>What is Git? Git is used to track changes in computer programs. It can be used to change files remotely.</p>
				<p>Who started Git? Linus Torvalds invented Git. He is the same person who created Linux.</p>
				<p>What is Hub? When talking about information technology, a hub is a common connection point for devices in the network.</p>
				<p>Describe Repository and its role? The repository is the most basic element of Git Hub, it contains all of the project files, and stores each file's edit history.</p>
				<p>Your thoughts about GitHub. GitHub seems like a really useful tool. However, I do not like it right at this moment, because I haven't written html since the Myspace days, and this is frustrating me.</p>
